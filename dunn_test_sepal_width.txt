                  setosa    versicolor     virginica
setosa      1.000000e+00  2.047087e-14  2.304897e-07
versicolor  2.047087e-14  1.000000e+00  4.742801e-02
virginica   2.304897e-07  4.742801e-02  1.000000e+00

Interpretation:
Dunn’s post-hoc test for sepal_width:
  setosa vs setosa: p = 1.0000 (p>0.05): Fail to reject H0; groups are not significantly different.
  setosa vs versicolor: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  setosa vs virginica: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  versicolor vs setosa: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  versicolor vs versicolor: p = 1.0000 (p>0.05): Fail to reject H0; groups are not significantly different.
  versicolor vs virginica: p = 0.0474 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  virginica vs setosa: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
