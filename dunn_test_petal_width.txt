versicolor  1.117408e-08  1.000000e+00  8.282773e-08
virginica   6.898535e-30  8.282773e-08  1.000000e+00

Interpretation:
Dunn’s post-hoc test for petal_width:
  setosa vs setosa: p = 1.0000 (p>0.05): Fail to reject H0; groups are not significantly different.
  setosa vs versicolor: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  setosa vs virginica: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  versicolor vs setosa: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  versicolor vs versicolor: p = 1.0000 (p>0.05): Fail to reject H0; groups are not significantly different.
  versicolor vs virginica: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  virginica vs setosa: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
