Dunn's post hoc test for sepal_length (Bonferroni adjusted):
                  setosa    versicolor     virginica
setosa      1.000000e+00  3.058513e-09  6.000296e-22
versicolor  3.058513e-09  1.000000e+00  8.324597e-04
virginica   6.000296e-22  8.324597e-04  1.000000e+00

Interpretation:
Dunn’s post-hoc test for sepal_length:
  setosa vs setosa: p = 1.0000 (p>0.05): Fail to reject H0; groups are not significantly different.
  setosa vs versicolor: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  setosa vs virginica: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  versicolor vs setosa: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  versicolor vs versicolor: p = 1.0000 (p>0.05): Fail to reject H0; groups are not significantly different.
  versicolor vs virginica: p = 0.0008 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  virginica vs setosa: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  virginica vs versicolor: p = 0.0008 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
