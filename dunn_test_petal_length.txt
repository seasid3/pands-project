Dunn's post hoc test for petal_length (Bonferroni adjusted):
                  setosa    versicolor     virginica
setosa      1.000000e+00  1.363763e-08  1.015399e-29
versicolor  1.363763e-08  1.000000e+00  8.309872e-08
virginica   1.015399e-29  8.309872e-08  1.000000e+00

Interpretation:
Dunns post-hoc test for petal_length:
  setosa vs setosa: p = 1.0000 (p>0.05): Fail to reject H0; groups are not significantly different.
  setosa vs versicolor: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  setosa vs virginica: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  versicolor vs setosa: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  versicolor vs versicolor: p = 1.0000 (p>0.05): Fail to reject H0; groups are not significantly different.
  versicolor vs virginica: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  virginica vs setosa: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  virginica vs versicolor: p = 0.0000 (p<0.05): Reject H0; groups are significantly different.
  virginica vs virginica: p = 1.0000 (p>0.05): Fail to reject H0; groups are not significantly different.
